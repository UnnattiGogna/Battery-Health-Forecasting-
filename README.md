# 🔋 EV Battery Health Prediction ML

Predict and monitor the **battery health (State of Health – SOH)** of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using real-world performance, charging, and environmental data.
This helps manufacturers, fleet owners, and individual users **detect battery degradation early** and **extend battery lifespan** efficiently.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Battery degradation is one of the most critical challenges for Electric Vehicles.
Over time, due to charging cycles, temperature fluctuations, and driving behavior, the **battery’s State of Health (SOH)** declines — reducing range and performance.

The goal of this project is to build an **ML model** that can accurately **predict the battery’s SOH** based on various measurable factors like:

* Battery voltage and current
* Charging and discharging cycles
* Temperature and ambient conditions
* Energy consumption patterns
* Vehicle model and manufacturer

This prediction allows users to monitor **battery condition**, **plan replacements**, and **optimize charging behavior** proactively.

## 🛠️ Approach / Solution

I have designed and trained a regression model to estimate the **SOH** of EV batteries.
Here’s how I've approached the problem step-by-step:

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning

* Merged multiple EV datasets containing **battery specs**, **charging patterns**, and **vehicle information**.
* Removed missing or inconsistent entries.
* Engineered new features such as:

  * Temperature-centered and temperature-squared columns
  * Normalized voltage and cycle-based degradation ratios

🧾 Final dataset: `final_merged_ev_dataset.csv`

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed correlations between temperature, cycles, and SOH.
* Visualized degradation patterns across brands and time.
* Identified **key influencing features** — temperature, charge cycles, and voltage had the strongest correlation with SOH drop.
