# Battery-Health-Forecasting-
Electric vehicle batteries slowly lose health over time due to driving habits, charging patterns and temperature conditions.
This project uses Generative AI to forecast and simulate how an EV battery’s health will change in the future — under different usage and sustainability scenarios.
Instead of giving one fixed prediction, our AI imagines multiple possible futures for a battery — showing how small behavior changes (like avoiding fast charging or extreme SoC ranges) can make it last years longer.

The system learns from real-world EV data such as:
1.State of Charge (SoC)
2.State of Health (SoH)
3.Battery temperature
4.Battery capacity
5.Driving and charging behavior

Using this data the model will be able to:
1.Predict battery degradation patterns over time
2.Generate multiple “what-if” scenarios to show how user behavior impacts battery life
3.Promote sustainable driving and charging habits
4.Support circular economy decisions by identifying when batteries can be repurposed for second-life use

Ultimately, this project will help both EV users and manufacturers make smarter, greener, and longer-lasting decisions — powering sustainability with AI.
